# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer is a deep learning-based project that blends the *content* of one image with the *style* of another to generate a visually appealing, artistic output. This implementation allows users to upload two images — a content image and a style image — and generate a stylized version of the content image using deep convolutional neural networks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload any content and style image
- Generate high-quality stylized output
- Built using PyTorch and Flask
- Clean web interface (if Flask UI is integrated)
- Easy to run and extend

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The model minimizes the content loss and style loss by optimizing the generated image iteratively using VGG19 (a pre-trained convolutional network).

- **Content Loss**: Ensures the output resembles the structure of the content image.
- **Style Loss**: Ensures the output reflects the textures and colors of the style image.
